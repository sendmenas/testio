## Observations and Tips

- `FooterContainer.js` all data should come from store. All extra information sources like localstorage, cookies etc, should moved to store, in app initialization state.
- `FooterContainer.js` logout action should be moved to `thunk/saga/redux-observable`
- `reducers.js` all mutations and side effects should be moved to `thunk/saga/redux-observable` layer. example getTime function, localStorage.setItem()

- `package.json` implement autofix function
- What's the difference between `.eslintrc.js` and `.eslintrc.json`?
